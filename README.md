# VISINT-YOLO

A repository with code for our mini-project in TDT-17 - Visuall Intelligence.

Mainly a fork of the [YOLOv5 repo](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) made by [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/).

We have also added som preprocessing scripts to make the data provided trainable and some scripts to transform labels into other categories for validation.

Locally we also have a data folder that contains the data provided.
